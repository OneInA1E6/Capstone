# Peer Testing 1
## Version: User Feedback
### Administrator: Gabriel McLachlan

#### Accommodation 
- The accomodation page cards have both number of rooms and Number of rooms available
- The ui is intuitive and makes needed functions memorable
    - saw that the create button is at the top
    - the new group is added to the bottom as expected

- Deletion is quick, obvious, and popup gives immediate feedback
    - Seems like the kind of thing that could use a confirmation
    - really easy to accidentally delete the wrong one

#### Group 
- Started putting full name into firstname 
- The adding members button is useful and quick
- Additional contact info is not very intutive
    - Using a dropdown would probably be useful instead of inputting the type.
    - Or a checkbox 

- Overall the group system is easy to follow though
- having Google autofill compatible forms could make it simpler
    - (Gabe note, probably not, since the RA would be registering people)

#### Booking

- Creating a new booking is simple, but too barebones
    - People may forget the newly created group ID, 
    - there's no information about Accommodation id, need to go back and lose form data
    - Additionally, duration isn't descriptive
        - expects a number, but we don't know what that number represents
  

#### Misc other tasks

- Changing the accommodation's name is easy if you know the accomodation id
    - This being said, it's maybe not the best to require the user to remember ids.
- deleting a booking that's not at the top isn't as reactive
    - flash message doesn't show up if you aren't at the top of the page.
    
### Overall Opinions
- Site is structured good for the process if it is this sequential
    - Accommodation -> Groups -> Booking is good
- only hiccups were caused by assumptions from other software on the internet.
- Cards were good for some things, not for others
    - looking through cards for number of people in a group isn't the easiest 
        - really difficult to find "most" group members, and would be harder with more members
        - a sorting or filter function could really help with this.
            - Filter by id or name etc etc. would be useful
- Double deleting is a real threat without some sort of confirmation.

- Overall, really intuitive, no real cluter or convelution
- 95% of the time knew exactly where to go, and where to find info
- suggestion would be to add the confirmation OR have some sort of record to be able  to bring back old groups/bookings
