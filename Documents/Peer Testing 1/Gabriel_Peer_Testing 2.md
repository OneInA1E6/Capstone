#### Accommodation 
- the dashboard searchbar feature was used, because he saw it right when he logged in
- scrolled down to find the proper accommodation
- creation of the accommodation went smoothly
- Deletion hit a bug
    - (future Gabe: that was due to an accidental change and save to files)
- everything was intuitively placed
- his assumptions had him looking for the add accommodation function in the middle of the page
  - then looked up and found it easily with no struggle though
  - 

#### Group 
- expected the new group button to be in a similar position
- Name wasn't an issue, but adding group members was
    -  didn't click the add member button
- Similar situation with the additional contact info
- didn't end up seeing the buttons for the contact info and group members
    - The main reasons for this was the space to the right of the group member names
        - adding the button on the left could be more intuitve
    - The contact info also looked like a form submission button
        - some separation from the rest of the form would likely be benificial to indicate

#### Booking

- Creating a new booking looks pretty confusing.
    - remembering the group ID is easy if you come right from group creation
    - Don't really know what to put for the accommodation ID,
        - Didn't see an ID when on the accommodation page, so have to go back
            - having accommodation information could be benificial
        - Potentially better to have that information in a side bar on the right
            - For group information, having the number of people and other relevant information
- Even jst hints or tooltips could be really beneficial
- 

#### Misc other tasks

- The addition of a searchbar would be really useful for when you need to look for specific info
    - ordering by ID or Name or Group members would be very useful for finding specific models
    - Just different categories and query limiters would be great.
    
### Overall Opinions
- Website is easy to use, not overcrouded, and there arent unneccesaru features
- Everything works together, it's evidently one website. 
    - overarching layout helps to coordinate and make it feel like one cohesive product
- no matter where you go the side bar always allows for quick navigation
