- Review styling changes Michael made
    - Move delete button to right side of card
    - Change buttons to text rather than images
    - Change button colours: delete -> red, create -> green
    - Styling for group edit form
- Review feedback for usability tasks

# 9:40
- Revise the usability tasks list

Ideas for next iterations, ideally for peer testing:
- Group card should include ID, phone number, and show whether it has been booked. Maybe include a booking button?
- Accommodation card include add new booking button?
- Pages should have their own search tool
- Creating bookings should have a more robust input feature for Group and Accommodations ID
