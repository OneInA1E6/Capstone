### 4:00
- George, Gabriel and Akshaj join the chat
- Gabriel says that he can't speak, since he forgot his microphone, so he'll just be typing in chat

- Mashad hasn't shown up, so we chat for a few minutes

## Project Update
### 4:05
- Mashad still hasn't shown up, so we start with the project update
- Akshaj's group is about 80-90% finished creating the pages, then they just need to set up the database stuff
- Gabriel's group is working with setting up the pages, and passing models to props on the frontend.
- Mashad is still a no show

### 4:08
- nobody had any questions, but wanted to give Mashad some time to show up still.
- Michael hasn't had many conversations with Emergency Services personel, so nothing new to report
- Have a small conversation about flexibility and how if we want to change anything that we think may 
  work better, then we can feel free
    - Thank George for the communication
  
### 4:10
- Talk a bit about the project demos
    - George may be interested in coming down to the university when they happen
    - Says Michael probably would be too
    - We'll have to figure that out in the next month
  
## Closing
### 4:15
- Mashad _still_ hasn't shown up, so we'll probably call it there
