# COSC499 Client Meeting 13 / Project Showcase

Date: Monday, December 12th, 2022

Time: 3:30PM-4:30PM

Location: UBCO Capstone Discord Channel

*Gabriel is the Client Liason for Group A, alongside Mashad (Group B) and Akshaj (Group C)*

### 3:30
- Gabriel and George join chat
- Greetings and what not.
- George is looking forward to the demonstration

### 3:31-4:00
- PHP updated recently and the auto update to 8.2 ruined the artisan commands.
- Spent 30 minutes fixing that 
    - Had to downgrade to PHP8.1, wasn't too hard but wasn't obvious.

### 4:00
- Mashad and Akshaj nowhere to be seen
    - Were probably busy with exams, either way, no shows
- George decides that if they're not going to join, may as well start with the presentation

## Project Presentation
### GEMS Group A

This is a general outline of the things that were mentioned/suggested to change. 
The whole web app was shown, but only significant notes were taken.

#### Accommodations
- Number of available rooms only really considers hotels
    - Should next take into account other things like university floors or just makeshift cots
    - available rooms itself isn't the best metric, it's more about available capacity
      - Rooms is okay to find a way to split groups or designate pet areas, but occupancy available should be its own thing
- For filters (e.x. pet friendly or handicap accessable): what happens if there are no rooms with the requirements? 
    - Will you send them to a new region entirely? Will there be animal shelters with occupancy?
    - George himself said that that's not an issue we need to tackle, just something that needs to be figured out in the future.
- The forms for adding accomodations needs some work

#### Regions Questions
- Question (Gabriel): Do we have a plan with how to determine or set the regions? 
    - Answer: For now it's just the Government of BC or Canada working with the app, so we only need to worry about BC regions and BC accommodations
- Question: What about agent's particular region? Should those be self assigned, or do all agents just see all accomodations?
    - Same kind of thing, we're just worrying about BC right now, so no need to do any assignment or filtering unless you want to
    - Will probably need to be a super user to set an agent's region in the future, but don't worry about it right now.
    - Gabriel thinking: we can probably for now do a "preferences" tab to set regions, but not have it be a hard set thing
    
#### Groups
- Looks pretty good, and lots of information
- Should probably add the main contact information right on the card
    - Quick contactability at a glance
- Suggestion to work on: Differentiating between civilians and Emergency Groups 
    - Gotta plan for filtering here as well, as it's important to make sure people are in the right places
    - 
#### Bookings
- Bookings is still a hard WIP
    - George says that's okay since even though it's the main feature, it's still the fuzziest to define
    - Going to try to talk to Michael.
- Add booking form isn't the greatest, but it sounds like you're planning to change it
- Similar suggestion to group, adding EMS flag and adding filter
#### Overall Opinion
- The site is really clean
- Dashboard is nice
    - left side navbar is great
    - Different buttons though, it's hard to see which one is selected
    - Maybe more obvious that it's clicked or tabs to show which is selected
- Overall a really great base to work from
- It feels like more than a concept, it looks and feels like a proper website
    - even with the WIP bookings
  
### Conclusion
- There's nothing much more to update
- If we have any questions going forward about anything, feel free to ask
    - The sooner the questions are answered, the better
- Mashad and Akshaj still haven't shown up
- So I guess we're done for the day
