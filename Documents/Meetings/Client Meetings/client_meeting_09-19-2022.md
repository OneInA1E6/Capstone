# COSC499 Client Meeting 2
Date: Monday, September 26th, 2022
Time: 5PM-6PM
Location: UBCO Capstone Discord Channel

*Gabriel is the Client Liason for Group A, alongside the other liasons Mashad (Group B) and Akshaj (Group C)*

As per the document, only the Client Liasons showed up. May change as more questions arise.

### 5:30
- Joined the Discord Voicechat alongside Akshaj and George from Glohaven
- Mashad was having trouble finding which Discord we were in
- Asked George how things were going at the company, says it's going well
- George asked how the first few weeks of school have been

### 5:35
- Mashad finally finds his way into the Discord. Greetings all around.
- George decides that we should start with any questions before we report our progress.


## Questions Period
### 5:38
 - Question (Gabriel): "We did an excercise in class last week on use cases, and Group A was confused on how the chain of events goes. We were just wondering if you could clarify why the reservation agent needs to log in, and if they log in for every call they recieve?"

	- Answer: "The website will be live on the internet, and will be available to the public, so there will be a generic landing page. But for now, we're only going to be making the tools for the reservation agent. (Maybe in the future there will be a way for the public to make their groups.)So we need the log in to make sure that the public can't access those tools. As for the logging in every time, the reservation agent just logs in and THEN he recieves calls, so he can input the information and create a booking or a group entity. (i.e. just log in once, then does his job.)"

### 5:42
- Question (Akshaj): "So it`s the reservation agent creating the accomodation?"
	- Answer: "Yes, the reservation agent is the one that creates the accomodation, and as accomodations change or free up, he`s the one that handles it"
-Follow-Up (Akshaj): "If it's the reservation agent is the one creating the booking, then what if all the accomodations are booked? Does he just call and see what's free?"
	- George doesn't understand the question
- (Akshaj)	    "Like, what if someone booked at a hotel, and rooms weren't available? What if they didn't book with Glohaven?"
	- Answer: "Oh, no, the accomodations will only be through Glohaven.
		 The reservation agent will be someone from emergency services or the BC government that will have the accomodations that hotels and other entities agree to provide.
		 Like, if a school has a gym floor or a hotel gives 50 emergency rooms, then those are set aside for emergency services, and will only be booked through Glohaven"

### 5:48
- Question (Gabriel): "Relating to that, does that mean that the reservation agent will be the one inputting the accomodation information?"
	- Answer: "Yes, as of right now, he's the one that will handle it all, inputting accomodations, that information, and the group information and bookings as well."

- Follow-Up (Gabriel): "So there's only one user for all of these different jobs?"
	- Answer: "For right now, yes. 99% of the site's usage will be with the reservation agent for right now. Maybe in the future, if we wanted to go down that route, we could have multiple users for putting in accomodation information, and doing the bookings, but it's not a requirement for right now."

### 5:53
- Question (Gabriel): "One more question, is there a specific way that the agent will put in the information? Like will it be it's own page, or should it be a CSV reader?"
	- Answer: "In the future, it would probably be good to have both, for flexibility, but for now, it should be its own input page with all the relevent fields."
- Mashad doesn't have any questions.

## Progress report.
### 5:55 
- None of us have really done much do do with this particular project aside from team meetings.
- Akshaj says that Group C is setting up the repo this week though, and will give a progress report next week.
- Gabriel says that Group A has set up the repo and have just been making the Super-Tasks and milestones. Can probably give a progress report next week.
- Mashad says that Group B is meeting on Tuesday, and will let George know next week or in Discord if anything big comes up.

## The Message from Michael.
### 6:00
- Earlier on Monday, Michael sent a large message in Discord relating to a meeting he had with a couple of Emergency Support Services Directors
	- Has let us know that they're frustrated with the lack of tools to manage these situations.
	- Will be giving Michael a list of the important aspects and questions that pertain to accomodations, booking accomodations, and many other things
	
- George has said that that update was primarily to keep us updated and help us to feel involved and help with the ideas that we may try to impliment
	- Says he'll distill all of the information to what will be useful for the job at hand right now.
	- Says he'll update the document that they gave us, so we should keep our eyes open for that.

- For right now, the base use case has been set in stone, and that won't change at all. If anything else is added, it'll just be extra on top of that.

## Closing

- Nothing much else to talk about on the liason side

- George says that today was okay for meeting time, but wouldn't work generally. Mondays at 4:00 should be when we start from now on
	- will also have to figure out when holidays are on Mondays. Will go on case by case basis.

### 6:05
Meeting Ajourned.

## The Glohaven Story
### 1:12

- Aiming to build a building a digital destination management ecosystem to support local community and tourism sectors
- Want to empower tourism with the tools and data to function better in this digital world
- Michael's Story
	- Comes from a long line of entrepreneurs
	- Instilled importance of community and time
	- Fell in love with tourism at a young age at Lake Louise in Banff
		- Wanted to live there some day, so he did
	- Worked at resort near Lake Louise
	- Led to tourism and media sales
	- Moved to Okanagan in 2007
		- Founded a digital media company focused on videos
		- won multiple awards and helped to support and expand local tourism

	- Gave a foundation for leading teams
		- Helped him learn how to manage projects under pressure
	- Has had many hardships, both in firefighting and with health issues
	- 2014 said that if he made it through, then he'd devote his life to making meaningful and impactful change
		- does it where he knows he can, in the tourism sector

### The GEMS Goal
## 1:23
- Hard for community and tourism to be successful if it's not accessable
- last few years have had numerous issues plaguing the industry
	- Covid
	- natural disasters
	- in all of this (especially Covid) many people have turned to online solutions for their entertainment and exploration needs
- Issue: there's no community or access to local solely from online.
- Issue: the big companies extract billionso f dollars from communities
- Issue: the status quo is just not sustainable for communities or business
	- example: when planning trips in BC, tourists attend an average of 38 websites
- **Solution:** a platform and toolset built by the tourism industry, for the tourism industry.
- Issue: there's a huge gap in the technology when it comes to this regard, which just leads to...
	- Revenue loss
	- Unemployment
	- Consumer frustration
	- Disruption of life, with no way to accomodate
- That's where GEMS, and us in the capstone project, comes in

## Where GEMS Comes In
### 1:30
- When there's emergencies or big events going on, there's usually software involved to try to coordinate everything
	- The issue is that it's not exactly suited to handle such big events
		- take 2017, 2018 and 2021 fire seasons as an example, they were absolutely awful
- there's no technology, so people just end up calling hotels, motels accomodation
	- Fine to a point, but with thousands of evacuees and Emergency Service people,  eventually becomes too much to handle
- Mike saw this as an opportunity to do better
- The whole tourism industry are looking to create and utilize tools to manage tourism, everything from marketing to destination mangement
- some sectors use things like Shopify and Hubspot, but they're not really tailored to the tourism sector only sows frustration
- This all led to conversations to provide digital infrastructure
	- instead of everything being fragmented, community based marketplaces is the plan
	- idea is to divert consumer traffic away from the giants, to this centralized place
	- gives each community the tools for buisiness and communications

## GEMS
### 1:35

- Idea is to be kind of like a plugin to their main community based hub and project
- This idea has potential to go beyond emergency management, to big events like the BC Winter Games and other things that need accomodation
- Give the coordinators and people who need it the data and dashboards to set this kind of stuff up

- There are some very intererested parties in this regard like
	- BC Hotel Association
	- Thompson-Okanagan Tourism
		- side note, leaders in sustainable tourism. Very cool
	- Indigenous Tourism
	- And the team of all sorts of industry leaders at Glohaven
	- All want to continue the conversation
	- All want this to be better, not just for the organizaitons but for all the customors
- All this to say the requirements will likely evolve as we go forward
- Project built on the values of collaboration and sustainability
- All with the creative and inovative minds all around, as it's the minds of the community that give this project the best shot at success

## Wrap up to the Story
### 1:40
- During treatment for health, everything tasted like cardboard,
- One day in August, is handed a peach by in laws
- the peach was like a difribliator to his tastebuds
- the type of peach was a Glohaven, grown locally in the Okanagan.

- A year later when Michael was trying to name the project
	- Wasn't sure what to call it
- Went to the orchard where the peach was from, and his wife suggests: Why not call it Glohaven

- That's the seed that planted the idea to call it Glohaven

- He appreciates that we've taken the time to hear about the hopes and dreams for the future.

## The Requirement For The Project
### 1:45
- Over to Adrian and George

- The team at Glohaven made a requirements document (link): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QihJwHGf21KwdMD0RD1Cv3IDLi0mGxSd2uo_oKJF6tQ/edit?usp=sharing
	- Will be updated over time
- Main idea is to hold to that

### THE TECH STACK

- Only hard requirement is Laravel, a PHP framework that works very well with MySQL and MariaDB
	- Would also like it if we handle authentication with Laravel Breeze
	- Lots of freedom for the rest, though they will recommend that we use VueJS and Inertia (integrates very well with Laravel and Vue)
	- Livewire is also an option for that middleman
- Laravel docs are very helpful and friendly to work with
- Laravel is built to integrate well with Vue, no weird things to make it work, it's a pre packaged platform.

### IDEA BEHIND THE APP
- a basic Create, Update, Read, Delete (CRUD) application
	
- 3 main entities: Accomodations, Groups, and Regions
	- REGIONS: things like the Thompson-Okanagan, Kootneys, Greater Vancouver Area. Essentially a container for groups
		- only Canadian Provinces
		- Regions will have acommodations
	- ACCOMODATIONS: the places where people will be able to stay if they are evacuated or volunteering somewhere.
		- Will be things like hotels, motels, makeshift acommodations, etc.
			- Makeshift Accommodations are like Gymnasiums with mattresses on the ground.
		- Emphasis is on hotels though, as they have agreements with local municipality to help out in those kinds of scenarios.
	- GROUPS: The thing that ties it all together, groups of 1 or more people that are in need of a place to stay for an event or emergency
 		- When people are evacuated, this is how they're handled
		- When people volunteer and dont stay in camps built, then they also need volunteers
		- Also can one day extend to athletes or other groups for big events

### Some key features:
- Search system of some kind
	- since there's no tech for this, we've seen people organizing with nothing more than an excel spreadsheet
		- Doesn't scale very big, nor very good
	- to have a system where you can simply search up for accomodations, groups or regions, like a fuzzy search, would be very good to have. Powerful tool.
	- Don't need to make Google, just something that works
	- Possibilities: fuzzy search, tag filtering

- MAIN FEATURE: booking and reservation system. This is the "bread and butter" of the app.
	- Important groups to be able to be booked at accomodations
	- one day will hopefully integrate with some cloud based inventory with the SABRE API

### HOSTING THE STACK
- Laravel works nicely with everything, but if using windows, either use a Virtual Machine, or Windows subsystem for Linux.
- For mail hosting, they recommend Mailtrap.io

**Final note**: feel free to play around, the only hard requirement is Laravel.

## Question Period
### 1:55

Most of the agreed upon questions from the Liasons were answered in the information period, but a few weren't. 

Plus after hearing the scenario, a few people also chimed in with questions
- Question (Gabriel): "Client-side wise, what kinds of devices will we have to deal with. Is this going to be an app or solely a webapp?"
	- Answer: We only have to worry about the web app side of it.
		- As a bonus, if people are able to create or figure out the routing for and API that could be used by some future app that would be really cool, but for now, just working on the web app side of it

- Question: "Question about the search system, are we able to use things like tags to help with filtering"
	- Answer: That's a great idea, and in general if you have any ideas feel free to try them out. All we're looking for is a rudimentary list, like the fuzzy finder system in Mac or like Ctrl+P in VSCode, but if you want to try this other ideas, a filtering either search results, or search results by options, then that's awesome.

- Question: "Is the site more focused on pre-emergency planning, like pre-fire season, or is it more supposed to be a fluid quick and easy system for accomodation creation and booking."
	- Answer: Aspects of both would be awesome. Municipalities have information that can be gotten from entities like hotels, and so to be able to enterthat in beforehand would be useful, but it also needs to take into account makeshift accomodations like gym floors and booking for evacuees.

- Question: "Is there supposed to be logins for Emergency Personel and Evacuees"
	- Answer: "For now just deal with a single admin sign in, that would be used to create acommodations and connect bookings to groups.
		- For a bonus round, there's the potential for public facing reservations and creating a temporary account but at this point just an administrator login is fine.
	- That's a great idea for the future when it's not just emergency systems though
- Question:"Do we worry about payments?"
	- Answer: No, just worry about making a CRUD application.
	- The tourism sector itself is pretty foreign to the idea of subscriptions, so we don't need to worry about that

- Question (Gabriel): "What would be the preferred way of contacting you if we have any questions or issues that come up?"
	- Answer: Being remote, Glohaven is accustomed to the online workspace, 
	- There's a Discord that they have made that can be made that we can post questions. That's probably going to be much easier to get in contact with that way than via email, since they're on Discord all day, but only check emails once per day. 
	- Plus, they've made a channel dedicated to capstone students.
		- The discord in question: https://discord.gg/hCkerEqjJp
	
- Question (Gabriel): "With that, what times would likely work the best for future meetings."
	-Answer: It's more on the student's schedule, as we've got classes to accomodate for, so it's whoever needs to join whenever we can make it work.

## Farewells
### 2:10
- We all seem very excited for the opportunity, sounds like an awesome project.
- The Glohaven team also look forward to supporting and learning along side us all the way.
