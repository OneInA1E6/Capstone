*Gabriel is the Client Liason for Group A, alongside Mashad (Group B) and Akshaj (Group C)*

### 4:00
- George, Akshaj and Mashad join the chat
- Like a fool, Gabriel lost track of time and didn't show up on time
- Mashad just quickly popped in and left quickly
- Akshaj was similar
  - apparently they both have a lot of midterms this week. Unfortunate.
  
### 4:08
- Gabriel finally shows up. Akshaj and Mashad are already gone.
- Asks George if they had anything major to report with their groups
  - Akshaj's group is still working on trying to set up the database
  - Mashad's group is separating the programming into frontend and backend work
  - both pretty much the same as last week
- No updates from George regarding the project. Will let us know if that changes

## Project Update
### 4:10
- Group A didn't get much done over reading break, but some work was done on the groups model
  - pretty much the exact place we were last week.
  
## Question Period
- none of the groups had any questions.
- That includes Group A
  
## Closing
### 4:15
- George says that he's still working on seeing if there's any pictures we are able to use
- Gabriel says he's good to go and George agrees
- Have a good day, talk to you next week
