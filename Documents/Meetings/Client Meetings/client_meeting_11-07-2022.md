## Project Update

- Team A has been working hard in the last week to get the controllers set up and working on making Vue work well as well.
	- Michael has been working on a searching tool that will be used like the fuzzy finder we were talking about at the start
	- Tanner has been relearning the Vue props hydrating, and has done well on his branch to set up everything
	- Andrew finished his controller and is now working on connecting the models
	- this week we'll hopefully be working more on connecting the models and making the app layout for consistency through the whole app

- Team B
	- Mohammed (Tech Lead) has been the main force setting up the dev environment on all of the platforms
	- Brendan (Scrum Master) has been designing the UI prototype and working on the general ideas
	- Mashad and John have been working on the backend trying to get a dummy database working.
	- most everything is following Mohammed's lead though.

### 4:13
- Akshaj finally joins
- hellos, and George says that he joined just as we were finishing up the project update

- Team C
	- Not much to say for team C, apparently most of the pages are finished, then it's just the backend and seeing how that works

## Question Period
- Question (Akshaj): Do we have Glohaven photos or text for use in the UI or in general.
	- Answer: Yes, we should be able to provide some. Will ask Mike about it.
- (Mashad): Would the other groups be able to get that as well?
	-Answer: Yeah, we'll probably put it in a Google Drive and link it in the Discord for everyone to use

- That's it for now

## Closing
### 4:15
- George says that there's no big updates on their end.
- Gabriel, Mashad and Akshaj say there's nothing else to report.
