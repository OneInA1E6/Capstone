410, Todd, the glohaven cto joined just to listeN. Fly on the wall, cool beans.

410 Question(Gabriel)do you guys have any docker nformation and stuff
	my team was just trying to decide how to run the stack.


answer: docker has a bunch of online resources for education. Says he can ask adrian about it as well. What do we want to use it for?i

primarily redis and mysql,	do we want to use redis and mysql 
B
	george brings up that if you guys want to use those, then that's fine, but you guys don't have to if you don't want to. 
Todd chimes in,
Tod: if this will be integrated, then itd probably be best to keep it consistent.

George explains how it's its own separate thing. Thinks that it's fine, and if we find something then we can feel free to use it.


in case theres users on main platform that are using the other platform as well that will be integrated, Touch base as to if we need same database check with adrian and if thatll pose problems. For the capstone  db doesnt matter too mch.

Will ask the team about if we're wanting to use but will get an answer on redis and maria

One last question about ip agreement, if we will be 
	Gabe asks the other liasons if it was supposed to be made by us or by the University.
Says the university will provide one, but the temp is if any companies need it now. Ask george if he needs it. Says it's probably best to have one just in case.
temporary ip is for company agreement
