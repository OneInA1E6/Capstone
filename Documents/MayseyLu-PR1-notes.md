# Peer review 1 - Maysey Lu

### Think-aloud session:

- Darker shadow on boxes on dashboard - too white
- Is left side accommodations card bigger
- Top of accommodations wants a counter of total accommodations.
- Search isn't obvious that it's address or numRooms rather than both.
- Currently buggy searching for address after refresh
- For small accommodation successfully created put it on left, but toast would be right.
- Edit/delete needs to be on the same line if address pushes onto a second line or not.
- Button for current page should be different colour
- Validate real address
- numRooms on create accommodation breaks if string
- Are you sure you want to delete on trashcan.
- ex. John Smith rather than John Smith...
- Email/cell/types could be drop down
- Differentiate 'your' contact info from that of other groups, what if two primary contacts have the same names.
- Connect contact info to a member. Add contact info button on group member list.
- Create booking showing all groups/acc ids in drop down scrollable list.
- Duration of stay in days
- Search bar for each page.
