# Peer review 1 - Graham Itcush

### Thoughts while doing tasks

- not necessarily obvious that primary contact is already in group members
- Change address of booking is confusing, maybe display info of accommodation when you input id
- add group member could be formatted like contact type
- default dashboard view shows everything before search rather than nothing.
- search numRooms is == rather than >= 
- on info page from dashboard maybe make the book now button
- maybe just a view button in dashboard menu
- acc card number of total rooms

### After task suggestions

- List group id's when making booking or tell them to take note of group-ID, maybe same drop down for accommodation ID, maybe both acc and group have a book now button on their card. Maybe a button to view accommodations on the create booking screen.
- Have a FAQ page for when you get stuck
- Green button stands out like a sore thumb, maybe what we want.
- Huge add button under contact info looks like a finished creating group button.
- If didn't bounce between pages as much left side wouldn't be necessary but current style left bar constantly being there feels good.
- Are you sure you want to delete on button.
